Flipping tables by calling out pretense
People with rotten insides require polished outsides in order to assuage the seething guilt that incessantly haunts them. People who have done the work to polish their insides are able to set aside external pretense with ease. Jesus ate with sinners and caused quite a stir with the Pharisees.

While Trump is no saint, his stunt at McDonalds makes the head of leftists spin the same way the Lord did when he intentionally refused to wash his hands before eating, as the custom of the Pharisees required.

It reminds me of when I was a professor and intentionally ate Nalley Chili out of a can and drank a redneck-sized can of Arizona tea during lunchtime faculty meetings in silent protest against the pervading pretense that seemed unavoidable for my colleagues, who seemed to think that their full-time job was to defend their egos against the fact that we were all at a third-tier school.

The Lord said:

4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. (Matthew 23)


We would all do well to flip a few more tables.
